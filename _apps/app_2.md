description: 'I led the development of **Meplis Messenger**, a HIPAA-compliant iOS app built entirely in Objective-C that connects thousands of patients with their doctors. The challenge was fascinating: building real-time messaging with XMPP protocol, persistent socket connections to OpenFire server, and end-to-end AES-256 encryption for every bit of data. I implemented a multi-threaded architecture to handle concurrent REST APIs and bidirectional message streams without compromising the user experience. It''s rewarding knowing this infrastructure enabled secure medical file exchanges and improved healthcare communication.'
