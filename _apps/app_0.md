description: 'The "Meplis Messenger" app was written mainly in Objective-C and built at its core using XMPP. The processing of considerable amounts of data from various rest APIs required properly threaded interfaces. All incoming and outgoing data and databases were encrypted (AES-256) in order to meet HIPAA compliance. The main goal of the app is the enable patients and doctors to more efficiently communicate through a secure channel where they can exchange exams and other kinds of files.'
