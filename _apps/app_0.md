description: 'I developed **SimInspector** to solve a problem I faced daily: navigating iOS simulator data through terminal commands was painful. Built with SwiftUI and AppKit, this native macOS tool features real-time file monitoring powered by FSEvents, comprehensive simulator management, Quick Look integration and many more features. I focused on creating an experience that fellow developers and QAs could use immediately without any learning curve.'
