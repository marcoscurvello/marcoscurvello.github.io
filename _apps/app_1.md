description: 'The "Get Well Cities" app was written entirely in Swift and at its core powered by an elasticsearch rest API.  A multi-thread strategy was required to power many aspects of the app, an example is the geolocation based search for places, which processes the data and displays the information on a map simultaneously. The main goal of the app is to help people discover wellness places, websites, and events around them or in other cities so they can live a healthier life.'
