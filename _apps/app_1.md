description: 'I developed **Get Well Cities** entirely in Swift to help people discover wellness in their cities. It was an exciting technical challenge, implementing geospatial search with Elasticsearch that could find wellness venues in milliseconds across thousands of locations. I designed concurrent data pipelines to update maps in real-time while users searched, ensuring the interface remained responsive even with 100,000+ venues. It was fulfilling to create something that genuinely helped people find gyms, healthy restaurants, and wellness events to improve their lives.'
